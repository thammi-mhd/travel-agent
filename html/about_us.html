          <h5>ABOUT ME</h5>
          <h1>Mahammad Thameez</h1>
          <p>
            I am a motivated BCA student with a strong foundation in Python,
            HTML, CSS, and SQL, and a growing interest in artificial
            intelligence and machine learning. I actively solve Data Structures
            and Algorithms problems on LeetCode and enjoy building real-world
            Python projects that challenge my analytical thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond academics, I’m passionate about personal growth, maintaining
            discipline through fitness routines, and exploring creativity by
            analyzing storytelling in movies, series, and anime. I’m fluent in
            multiple languages including Malayalam, Kannada, English, Tamil, and
            Hindi, which helps me connect with diverse cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to apply my coding skills and problem-solving mindset in
            real-world projects, internships, or developer roles while
            continuing to expand my expertise in AI development.
